# Describe() gives us the mean wins across 3 surfaces along with the percentile distribution of players.

# In[18]:


print(SurfaceWin.median())   #Return Median of Surface win count


# Mean is sensitive to outliers. Players like Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal will cause skewness in the data due to comparatively higher wins than someone like Albot R. Median is used to eliminate the outliers' impact. Clearly, we have a difference in mean and median across the 3 surfaces. 

# Expertise(Win Rate) on surfaces can be used for correlation between different surfaces

# In[19]:


print(SurfaceWin.corr())    #Return correlation coefficient


# Following is the summarization of this correlation:
#  a. Clay court wins have a much higher influence on Hard court wins as compared to influencing Grass court wins
#  b. Higher wins in Grass Court has higher chance of wins in Hard court
#  c. Expertise in Hard Court allows a player to have higher chance of winning in Grass court and fairly similar in Clay court as well.An example of this claim would be Roger Federer. He has 42 wins on Hard Court, which correlates fairly well to his prowess on other surfaces.

# In[20]:


SurfaceWin.loc['Federer R.','Hard_w']   #Example, Roger Federer wins on Hard Surface

output = SurfaceWin.corr()


# Although, there is no strong correlation to answer the question, expertise in Hard Court Surface proves to best suited for influencing other surfaces' win-rate
