The	overall	goal	of	the	case	is	to	provide	actionable	insight,	based	on	the	data	available,	as	well	as	accurately	predict	which	people	(customers) will	be	expensive.
The	dataset	contains	healthcare cost	information from	an	HMO	(Health	Management Organization). 
Each row	in	the	dataset	represents a	person.	

The goal was to	understand the key drivers:

• Predict	people	who	will	spend	a	lot	of	money	on	health	care	next	year	(i.e.,	which
people	will	have	high	healthcare	costs).  
• Provide	actionable	insight	to	the	HMO,	in	terms	of	how	to	lower	their	total	health
care	costs,	by	providing	a	specific	recommendation	on	how	to	lower	health	care
costs.
